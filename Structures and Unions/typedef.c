//We use it like this to change the big function name in short form
// typedef <existing_name> <alias_name>  
// Like:  typedef unsigned int unt;     So when we create a unsigned int we have to write unt <variable_name>
// Also like: typedef int* pnt;         Se when we set a int pointer we don't have to weite int* a; We can write pnt a;

typedef struct student{

                    // So when we set a struct varible we can simply write std exchage of struct student.
